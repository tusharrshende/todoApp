# Todo App


## **Frameworks and Language Used:**
- Language: Java
- Framework: Spring Boot
- Database: Not specified, but using an in-memory list for data storage
- REST API: Used for communication with the frontend

## **Data Flow:**

1. **Controller (TodoController):**
   - Handles incoming HTTP requests.
   - Manages the RESTful API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting todos.
   - Utilizes Spring annotations for request mapping and dependency injection.

2. **Services:**
   - It seems that there are no explicit service classes defined in the provided code. In a typical Spring Boot application, services are used to implement business logic and act as an intermediary between controllers and repositories. It's common to define service classes to encapsulate the business logic for better separation of concerns.

3. **Repository (BeanBag):**
   - Acts as a data source for the application.
   - Creates and manages a List of `Todo` objects, which serves as an in-memory database.
   - Configured as a Spring Bean using the `@Bean` annotation, making it available for dependency injection.

4. **Database Design:**
   - The provided code does not specify a traditional database schema, as it uses an in-memory list (`ArrayList`) to store `Todo` objects. Therefore, there is no explicit database design.

## **Data Structure Used:**
- The primary data structure used in the project is a Java `ArrayList`. This `ArrayList` holds instances of the `Todo` class, representing the todos in memory. The `Todo` class itself is a custom data structure with fields for `todoId`, `todoName`, and `todoStatus`.

## **Project Summary:**
This project is a simple Java-based todo list application built using the Spring Boot framework. It provides a set of RESTful API endpoints for managing todos, including adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting tasks. Todos are stored in memory as a list of `Todo` objects. The project could benefit from adding service classes to handle business logic and separating concerns more effectively.
